Dining Hall Management System 
At Syracuse University, there are five major dining halls, namely Ernie, Shaw, Sadler, Brockway, and Graham. These dining halls collectively employ over 500 part-time student workers, who work to earn their weekly wages

At each dining hall, student supervisors manually manage the shifts of over 500 part-time student workers. These students pick shifts based on their preferred time slots, and the supervisors use Excel sheets to manage the scheduling process.

The current  process  at the dining halls is causing several issues, including errors in scheduling, confusion among student workers regarding their working hours, and a lack of transparency in tracking employee progress.

This project aims to create a comprehensive database for the dining halls to facilitate easy access to shift schedules and available working hours, reducing confusion and increasing transparency and efficiency for student employees, supervisors, and managers.
